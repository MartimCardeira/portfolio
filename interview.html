            <p>For my IB Extended Essay, I wrote about the Bosnian War. I aimed to
                assess the responsiblity of all foreign parties involved in the Srebrenica municipality towards the Srebrenica massacre. In my seek for
                perspectives on the event, I found Hasan Nuhanović, who not only survived the massacre as a victim,
                but also held links with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) which had been stationed in
                Bosnia & Herzegovina
                during the war as a peacekeeping force. <b> The main objective of this page is to serve as a reference that can be cited in my essay.</b>

            <p>
                <b>I see that you’ve worked with the Dutchbat from 1992-1995, is that right?
                </b>
                <br><br>
                Actually no, I worked with the UN, not really with Dutchbat, and that was between 93’ & 95’. The UN only
                came to Srebrenica in April 93’, basically one year after the war had already started. So we had no UN
                presence in that region at all, even though there was ethnic cleansing and genocide going on and so they
                only came one year later. And yes, I assisted the Dutch because they were a part of the same
                organisation which was called UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force), you know? The mission in Bosnia.
                <br><br><b>So, before you worked with the Dutch, what exactly were you doing in the UN?
                </b><br><br>I was working with- you know I learned English by myself during the first year of the war,
                so when the UN finally arrived, and as I said they arrived quite late, and they were deployed in some
                other parts of the country but not in our region at all. So when the UN finally arrived and they needed
                some people who spoke English, they hired me and a few other young men who spoke some English and I
                worked with the UN and then later it was in 94’, February, when the Dutch arrived- it was first the
                Canadians. But I was actually working with, directly with the UN military observers, the so-called UNMO,
                that was my job.
                <br><br><b>And your job was only translating or was there more to it?
                </b><br><br>Well, you know Martim, there is always more to it when you work as a translator in a UN
                mission, and especially in a situation like this, you know you really do all kinds of things, you
                provide for example the newcomers with all this information that they simply had not been given by
                anybody else! And some of these people came really, very badly prepared, you know, starting from the
                whole history of the region of the Balkans to the history of the war, 92’, 93’, 94’, 95’... you know…
                and all these cultural things and all these fine details and all of this and so it was a lot more than
                just translating at meetings or translating some documents. It was mostly translating at meetings, but
                these meetings were taking place inside the UN safe area but also outside the UN safe area and I was the
                only translator who actually worked with the UN on the Serbs’ side of the confrontation line, which was
                a very interesting experience for someone who is a Bosniak, you know this term Bosniaks? We prefer this
                term to the term muslims but ok but the term muslims was in official use until Dayton, you know Dayton
                agreement? It was only after the Dayton agreement was signed that there was a new constitution as a part
                of the Dayton and there was a new term introduced which was “Bosniaks”. There were three main ethnic
                groups living in Bosnia: Serbs, Croats & Bosniaks. But during the war the term muslims was used, I mean
                more or less officially.
                <br><br><b>Well I can imagine that’s quite a difficult job. From your experience, would you say that the
                    Canadians were more prepared- did they know more than the Dutch, or were they the same?
                </b><br><br>Well, maybe it’s not fair to say that, because we don’t know how the Candians would have
                acted in July 95’, I mean in the most critical days, July 95’ was the most critical period, we will
                never know that (how they would compare to the Dutchbat), but from my experience were, I don’t know,
                they were in terms of numbers fewer Canadians than the Dutch. The Dutch came with 600 soldiers and the
                Canadians with only 200 soldiers. But my experience with the Canadians is that they were more determined
                to do their job.
                <br><br><b>Ok, so you think the Candians had a better attitude?
                </b><br><br>I think so, I think so.<br><br>
                <b>And as a translator, did it cover all parts of life, or just important meetings (with the Dutch)?
                </b><br><br>We basically- the UN came there to maintain a ceasefire, the UN declared that area a UN safe
                area so there is no UN safe area without a ceasefire. So basically, what they did was to report
                ceasefire violations, and try to work with both sides that in cases of ceasefire violation, you know, we
                restore the ceasefire. The ceasefire was the precondition for the UN safe area to exist.
                <br><br><b>Right, but there was always that struggle to maintain a ceasefire?
                </b><br><br>You know the ceasefire was breached many times, but it was far, far less in terms of
                intensity than before the UN safe area was declared, so before the UN safe area was declared, there was
                open fighting going on, and killing, and starvation, we did not have any food at all… we were cut off
                from the rest of the world, even during the safe area time. But at least there was no fighting going,
                there was no, how do you say, high intensity military activity going on. That had ceased. But you know,
                people were still killed, you know, compared to the numbers before the UN safe area was declared, this
                was far, far less. In a way, the UN safe area worked, the concept worked for some time. You know, it
                basically froze, or as I say in my works, I published some scientific works, maybe you can have a look,
                my PhD thesis-
                <br><br><b>Yes, Sebina sent it to me and I did read it.
                </b><br><br>Yes, and I used the word “frozen” genocide or genocide interupted, so basically the genocide
                that was happening was interupted by the presence of the UN, that’s my thesis. One of the points in my
                thesis, and one of these people, Diego Arrias from Venezuela, who was in UN at the time, he used the
                word “slow-motion” genocide, so according to him to genocide has been put in slow-motion after the UN
                arrived. These are the terms. Because basically what you have is 40-45 thousand people living in an area
                that was about 130 square kilometres. More or less 9 kilometres by 12 kilometres, so imagine that kind
                of place, and that place is cut off from the rest of the world, completely… until July 95’ when it was
                overrun by Serb forces.<br><br><b>And so these safe zones were cut off not only from the Serb forces but
                    also the Bosniak forces?
                </b><br><br>Yeah, absolutely! I mean we were cut off from the rest of the country completely, I mean,
                nobody could get in or get out.
                <br><br><b>So would you argue these safe areas were very effective?
                </b><br><br>No, I mean, they were effective in the sense that the number of casualties during that time
                has decreased significantly. So basically, the point was to not allow physical contact between the Serb
                forces and the Bosniak population. If that physical contact happens, you know, we knew what was going to
                follow, and what followed in July 95’ was a massacre.
                <br><br><b>Right, going back to the Dutchbat, I read that you have a lot of incriminating evidence of
                    their wrongdoings?
                </b><br><br>Yes, it’s true. I think you can even use the term complicity in genocide when it comes to
                their role in Potočari on the 11, 12, 13th of July. I’m not talking about their role during the attack,
                it’s more complex, and it involves not only Dutchbat, the whole UN structure, with more countries
                involved. So i’m not talking about not protecting the UN safe area, this is a more complex issue and the
                Dutch are not the only ones responsible, but when it comes to the situation in Potočari, I think we can
                refer to it as complicity in genocide because the Dutch, you know, forcibly expelled the refugees in the
                UN base who were looking for shelter, and they handed these people over to the Serbs, and the Serbs
                killed all the men and the boys. And they handed over my family, in front of my eyes.
                <br><br><b>I understand, and did they ever give you a reason for that? Did they ever state why?
                </b><br><br>No, they actually denied in the court for 12 years, they denied they even did that. That’s
                what they said in the court. They said the Dutchbat never expelled any refugees from their bases. That’s
                what they said. You know, that’s what they put on paper.
                <br><br><b>Did anyone manage to keep any physical evidence of this happening, or did they destroy all
                    evidence?
                </b><br><br>Well, you know, they were all witnesses of what happened, and you know the refugees who
                survived were all witnesses of what happened and I was the witness of what happened, and the evidence
                also existed in the list, they created the list, where they asked the refugees to create a list of the
                men and refugees inside the base and there was a list with some names, not all of them, so the list had
                been hidden for some time by the Dutch but I managed to find this list several months later. I managed
                to find the list and that was the physical evidence that these 240 men and boys were inside the base.
                And right now, the Dutch government is paying compensation to the families of these people. But it took
                a long time to win this case in court.
                <br><br><b>Was it in 2011 that you won the case?
                </b><br><br>I won the case in… 2011 and then in 2013 it was confirmed by the Supreme court.
                <br><br><b>So quite a long time.
                </b><br><br>Yeah, very long time.
                <br><br><b>Ok, and the purpose of this list, what was it?
                </b><br><br>I really don’t know, I mean the people wanted to stay on the base, staying on the base meant
                you lived, leaving the base meant you died, and you know, it was the Dutch who asked for the list, but
                the list did not help anybody. They kept the list and expelled the people. So you know it didn’t help
                anybody at that moment.
                <br><br><b>I understand. I’ve read some things, apparently there was some amateur Serb footage of the
                    Dutchbat that (the Dutchbat) tried to destroy. I wanted to ask you, if you think this was a rumour
                    fabricated by the Serbs or it actually happened?
                </b><br><br>A footage that the Dutch had destroyed? Actually, you know what, I don’t know about the
                footage, but I know, this is a fact, it has been confirmed in so many reports that the Dutch had
                photographed dead bodies of some of the victims who were killed in the immediate vicinity of the base
                and these photographs were, I mean these films, negatives were destroyed somehow they say by accident in
                the Netherlands.
                <br><br><b>In the Netherlands?
                </b><br><br>Yeah.
                <br><br><b>And the purpose of this was to not incriminate themselves?
                </b><br><br>I don’t know, it has never been clearly- you know they said it was an accident in the
                laboratory, and these photographs- in the military, Dutch military headquarters something like that. So
                you know, the soldiers or officers made these photographs and they just got destroyed.
                <br><br><b>And the footage was belonging to one camera or many?
                </b><br><br>I don’t remember the names now, I think I used to remember the names. It’s a fact, it’s
                something that you can find in some reports, these were some Dutch officers that were lieutenants,
                sargent or something that made these photographs and they saved them and they and the negatives were
                taken from them by the intelligence service of the Dutch army in the Netherlands and that’s it and they
                got lost.
                <br><br><b>Going back before 1995, we talked about the safe area, and we also talked about the Canadian
                    troops, and from what I understand, I think you mentioned this in your PhD, there was still genocide
                    happening when the Canadian troops were there. Is that correct?
                </b><br><br>Well, as I said, the number of casualties when the Canadians arrived has decreased
                significantly, I mean, you know, we can talk about several people being killed every month and then
                before the Canadians arrived it was hundreds every month, so as I said, before the arrival of the UN and
                the establishment of the UN safe area, called it genocide interupted. And the Diego from the UN at the
                time called it slow motion genocide and he refered not really to the number of casualties but to the
                conditions in which these people were kept. The living conditions.
                <br><br><b>And do you think maybe- with the information that I have the Canadians weren’t really
                    criticised, nowhere near as much as the Dutch, do you think if they swapped around and the Canadians
                    were in charge in 94’ and 95’, do you think they would also be blamed as a matter of circumstances
                    rather than actions?
                </b><br><br>No one can tell what would have happened had the Canadians been there and not the Dutch, but
                the Canadians saved more than 1000 Serbs in a similar situation 3 weeks after Srebrenica. So 3 weeks
                after Srebrenica in a place called Knin, in Croatia, the Serbs ran through the town including men, women
                and children and the Canadian saved these people on their base. That was after Srebrenica, but this was
                in Croatia, I mean in the same region. They kept these people on their base for 40 days and the Dutch
                kept their people on their base for 48 hours… before they expelled them.
                <br><br><b>Do you think personally that the Dutch were under more pressure than the Canadians?
                </b><br><br>Well they were definitely under more pressure because the Serbs attacked Srebrenica and
                overrun the safe area, that’s what happened during the Dutch term, it did not happen during the Canadian
                term.
                <br><br><b>If you, by those terms consider the Canadian term a success, would you attribute that
                    success-
                </b><br><br>Well..<br><br>
                <b>Or would you not call it a success?
                </b><br><br>I mean, the Serbs did not launch any major attack on Srebrenica during the Canadian time,
                and they did not launch a major attack during the Dutch time, until July 95’ because the Dutch had 3
                battalions deployed in Srebrenica over the period of 18 months and these battalions stayed for 6 months
                so it was: Dutchbat 1, Dutchbat 2, Dutchbat 3. So what happened in July 95’ was during the time of
                Dutchbat 3, so Dutchbat 1 and Dutchbat 2 did not have that kind of situation. As I said, the major
                attack, the offensive, you know, the objective, take the town, happened basically at the end of the term
                of Dutchbat 3 in July 95’.<br><br><b>Right, and so because of this, and the changing circumstances do
                    you think personally it’s impossible to compare all the different battalions to each other?
                </b><br><br>I would just say it wouldn’t be fair to compare them, because the circumstances were
                different. You know, but in terms of their attitude, you can compare it.
                <br><br><b>Right, and would you make the comment that the Dutchbat had a worse attitude?
                </b><br><br>Yes, Dutchbat 3 had a worse attitude than Dutchbat 1 and 2 unfortunately.
                <br><br><b>And sort of stepping away from that, due to the size of Dutchbat 3 it doesn’t really really
                    matter what the attitudes or actions were, the genocide was an inevitability because there’s just so
                    many Serbs. How far would you agree?
                </b><br><br>I don’t think so, that’s a very complex issue really, and then again we are talking about
                the whole structure of the UN, you know, mission in Bosnia. I don’t really know the precise number but
                in Bosnia at that time, you can try to check that somewhere, it must be available somewhere, I think
                there were like 25,000 troops at that time.
                <br><br><b>In total?
                </b><br><br>Yes in Bosnia. I think it was the British forces in central Bosnia, you had the Canadians,
                the French, the Spanish in the south, in Mostar, you had the Norbat, it was the Swedes, the Danes, and
                also the Norweigians in Tuzla which was quite close by. You know, I mean you simply had so much force in
                my opinion, you know in Bosnia that the UN could have, somebody may say they did not have enough time
                but it lasted for 6 days at least before Srebrenica fell, it lasted even longer actually. It lasted with
                more intensity, it lasted from the spring of 95’ and the Serbs stepped up their actions, their
                activities gradually as I wrote in one of my books Under the UN Flag testing the reaction of the UN. As
                there was no reaction from the UN they went further and then they tested it again and they went further…
                See what I mean? So no reaction from the UN when they [inaudible] the Serbs to actually try and take the
                town. So it’s, you know you have to look at the bigger picture. In one of the most important reports on
                Srebrenica is the UN report from 1999. It’s not completely objective or true I would say because I
                analysed it in my book and in my opinion the UN tried to cover up many facts. But according to this
                report for example, the UN report says like this, the Dutchbat did not fire a single round at the
                attacking Serb forces in July 95’.
                <br><br><b></b>Not a single round?
                <br><br>Not a single round, you can find the UN report online, 1999. This is what it says literally.
                <br><br><b>And for what reason (did they not fire)?
                </b><br><br>That’s more complex, you would have to read my book! I’m not asking you to read my book but
                you should also ask the Dutch.
                <br><br><b>And about that, about not firing a single bullet, I think the Dutch- some of them blamed it
                    on the Rules of Engagement from the UN?
                </b><br><br>Yeah, you are right about that. That is also something that I discussed in my book.
                <br><br><b>Did you- would you say that is a valid excuse?
                </b><br><br>You know what? I mean, really, that’s simply something that I would have to go into some
                details now and I’ll give you an example: if we say that in principle, according to these rules of
                engagement they could only use their weapons for self-defence. First of all, I don’t think this is a
                correct statement, maybe it’s written somewhere, but there needs to be more to it. For example, you have
                all these resolutions 819 & 824 & 826, these are UN resolutions. And in one of these resolutions it says
                that the UN has a mandate to call for airstrikes if the UN safe area is attacked. And we expected
                (civilians) the airstrikes, they would be the most effective to defend the safe area. The other thing is
                that there were so many situations on the ground during the days in July 95’ when the Dutch could use
                their weapons in compliance with these rules of engagement, for example, several times in their
                observation posts, where they were deployed, they were attacked. You know what I mean, there is a very
                simple way to put it, they were being shot at. And when you are being shot at, you know, you can refer
                to these rules of engagement and fire back, at least warning shots. At the same time, by firing back, in
                order to defend your own position, you are actually defending the UN safe area.
                <br><br><b>Right, so that would be self-defence.
                </b><br><br>Exactly, I mean it is a self defence, but at the same time as you are sitting at the border
                of the UN safe area you are defending the UN safe area, it’s very simple. You see what I mean?
                <br><br><b>Yes. And cases like Nordbat 2?-
                </b><br><br>Yeah, there were situations where they would use tanks when escorting this UNHCR convoy and
                then the Dutch said they did not have tanks but the Dutch had weapons they never used. The Dutch had
                mortars, machine guns and the Dutch had anti-tank missiles, missile systems. You know, and if we say
                they could not use anti-tank missiles in order to not escalate, they could at least have used their own
                personal weapons to at least fire over the heads of the attacking Serb forces just a warning shot. But
                they didn’t do that.
                <br><br><b>Right, and going back to the Nordbat, the broke the Rules of Engagement and they were
                    criticised for it, but, it could be argued the mission was successful because of that.
                </b><br><br>Yes, and listen Martim, even if we refer to these rules of engagement as if they were
                something, you know, carved in stone, I mean, there’s always a way to go around rules. If you really
                want to do your job, in a situation like this, you know if rules of engagement are going to serve as an
                excuse for your inaction, really I mean, then it’s just you know, it’s just I don’t know how to call it,
                it’s just an excuse. If the rules of engagement are going to be an excuse in UN missions like this in
                the future, then the question is, how do you prevent genocide, how do you prevent massacres, how do you
                do that? I mean you see people being massacred, you see people being subjected to expulsion, and then
                you just sit there and take this piece of paper from your bag and you sit there and wave and you know
                this our rules of engagement, there’s nothing we can do, I just cannot accept that. Then you know, even
                if can justify their lack of action in referring to this paper, then the question is, you know, who had
                drafted this document and with what purpose and then the question is can we call the UN to take the
                responsibility? It was simply not something that was drafted outside of the reality. It did not
                correspond to the reality. And then the question is okay, you know, this was July 95’ the war started in
                92’, so how were you not familiar with the reality on the ground? Where did you get your information
                from? Anyway, if an excuse for not preventing genocide is the Rules of Engagement, then my question is,
                thank you very much, you know, there’s nothing else we can talk about. We have basically blocked
                yourself from any meaningful actions. And you must’ve done that consciously then, and then you have
                consciously you know blocked yourself from any action to prevent genocide. Is that my problem? Who is to
                blame?
                <br><br><b>So do you think it’s more the Dutchbat’s problem for using it as an excuse or is it the UN’s
                    problem?
                </b><br><br>Everybody! You know everybody in this story, in this context we are speaking about things
                that happened post festum (too late), after the fact. We are all poking about this in retrospect of
                course and all of these players be it government or the UN itself, they always look for excuses, they
                look for excuses to protect their national interests.
                <br><br><b>And because of that, you say it’s excuses, would you say the Nordbat 2 did the right thing?
                </b><br><br>Of course they did! It was in the same UNPROFOR mission!
                <br><br><b>And moving away from that, you talked about the air support. The air support you talked
                    about, is that from NATO?
                </b><br><br>Yes.<br><br><b>Right, and there is some controversy, conflicting information about whether
                    the Dutchbat were refused this air support.
                </b><br><br>That’s also an issue that is more complex, it’s not black and white at all because the Dutch
                reportedly called for air strikes and then they changed their mind, the Dutchbat commander, he changed
                his mind every couple of hours, all these documents, at one point he asked for it, at another point he
                sent information that the airstrikes would only make the things worse. You know, I don’t know the exact
                words now, the airstrikes would escalate the situation. He said let’s wait and see how it develops on
                the ground so it’s not black and white.
                <br><br><b>So where they say they were refused air support, is this fake information?
                </b><br><br>I would say it’s not fake, maybe these requests were refused at one point, but at another
                point he himself, the commander of the Dutchbat, asked his superior commanders to wait with the
                airstrikes.
                <br><br><b>And seeing the success of NATO’s Operation Deliberate Force, which was of course after
                    Srebrenica, and how they resulted in the Dayton agreement, do you think this air support would’ve
                    been very beneficial?
                </b><br><br>Definitely, the Serbs in many reports, the Serbs have entered the town, the town’s outskirts
                with about 5 battle tanks and some more combat vehicles. There was a single road leading through the
                town, completely exposed. It really would not have been a difficult military task for NATO. In terms of
                the military context, the political context, that's something else. I can talk about this for hours but
                I’m just running out of energy. I’ve talked about this for 28 years.
                <br><br><b>Not regarding military, but once Naser Orić took power in Srebrenica he and his men turned to
                    the black market and hoarded supplies for themselves meaning that some civilians starved. So I have
                    to ask, do you remember this yourself and do you think the UN could’ve done something about this?
                </b><br><br>See, first of all I cannot confirm that because …I just can’t confirm that. It’s possible
                but I cannot confirm it and you know this sort of story in my opinion, has been exaggerated and in my
                opinion also… you know it is irrelevant when it comes to the conditions in which the people lived in in
                the UN safe area, the people as I said to you half an hour ago, the people lived, I mean they were
                alive, so until July 95’ the UN safe area concept worked at least in terms of people being able to
                survive, so really somebody brings in this sort story or black market or stuff like that. In every war
                there is a black market, and sometimes with sanctions in the war, the black war becomes normal. Before
                the war, the prices skyrocketed, food or anything else. That was not controlled by Oric or anyone else,
                by no one. That’s how things work in the war. You have lack of everything, the simple law of demand
                prevails and things are not available. And they were very very expensive, that’s how it is. You had a
                very similar situation in Sarajevo and I heard about similar situation in Syria in some parts of the
                country over the last couples years.
                <br><br><b>Ok, so you’re saying it’s irrelevant as long as people can survive inside the safe area?
                </b><br><br>Yes, I mean, really, that’s what I mean. The people did not die of starvation, there was
                enough food brought in by the UNHCR for the people to survive. It was very basic food items and you know
                the quantity was quite limited but still the people received some food and survived. The story of the
                Serbians the genocide is not about the people starving inside the safe area in July 95’ it’s about the
                people being killed by the Serb forces. We starved in 92’ and the beginning of 93’ until the UN safe
                area was established. That was the time of starvation.
                <br><br><b>Would you say the UN acted too late? Was it obvious that Serbians were always going to attack
                    Srebrenica?
                </b><br><br>You know, we were hoping when the UN arrived, finally, on 17th April, 93’ the Canadians
                arrived, they were physically, the UN became physically present in the UN safe area you know, we always
                feared there would be a massacre, but we could not imagine that we would be betrayed like this. I mean
                just look at the words, the UN safe area, and try to imagine the people living inside the UN safe area,
                including the word safe, including the word UN, in my opinion there isn’t a higher authority than the UN
                on this planet, at least nominally. So everything was there, the UN, the safe area. So of course, the
                people were hoping that they would be protected and safe. There was a genocide.
